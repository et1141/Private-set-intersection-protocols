 1. Install packages using pacman (for example to install libglib2.0-dev: "sudo pacman -S glib2")
    g++
    make
    libgmp-dev
    libglib2.0-dev
    libssl-dev
2. In terminal open directory when you want to clone repository. Then terminate: "git clone --recursive https://github.com/bluetrickpt/PSI"

3. run "cd PSI"

4. Righ now you can try to run command "make". If it will end without errors that great - you are done. However In this step I had two problems to solve:

4a: if you have some error about Mircale:
   -go to miracle directory: "cd src/externals/Miracl"
   -terminate: "git clone git@github.com:miracl/MIRACL.git"
   -go back " cd ../../../"
   -try to terminate "make" again

4b: if you get:
error:/usr/include/glib-2.0/glib/gtypes.h:34:10: fatal error: glibconfig.h: No such file or directory
    -make sure that you installed the package: "sudo pacman -S glib2"
    -important: terminate "sudo pacman -S pkg-config"
        (pkg-config is device to manage references in project)
    - try to terminate"make" again


5: check if installed properly: "make test"
